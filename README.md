# Example Components
Example ESP-32. There is also a legacy Arduino version available in the examples folder. 

## Future Plans

The project has (or will have) the following components that can be programmed with various example sketches (see the `examples` folder):

- ESP-32 microcontroller
- OLED display (see the `examples/esp32/st7789/README.md` for installation instructions)
- Speaker
- Microphone
- RGB Neopixel LED
- Gesture Sensor
- Motion Sensor
- Accelerometer
- Gyroscope
- Magnetometer
- Capacitive Touch Sensors
- Manual Power Switch
- Volume Control Knob
- Micro SD Card Slot
- 3.6V LiPo Battery
- USB-C Charging Port

Components all support 3.3V to minimise power consumption and to simplify the design.

The project can be (or will be) programmed to demonstrate features such as:

- Internet radio player
- MP3 player (from Micro SD card)
- Voice recognition
- Voice synthesis
- Translator
- Gesture control
- Tilt control
- Capacitive touch control
- Play games
- Display animations (moving eye etc.)
- Night light
- Security alarm
- Weather station
- Clock
- Timer
- Stopwatch
- Compass (?)
- Pedometer
- Chatbot
- Bluetooth connectivity
- WiFi connectivity
